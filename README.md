## Abstract
Millions of datasets and many models use the input datasets in COCO format. In this paper, we are converting the Deep PCB dataset to COCO format. The Deep PCB is a manufacturing defect data set. It has 1500 image pairs. Each has a template image & a test image. The template image has no defects & corresponding test image that has some defects with the annotations in a text file. The MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset is large-scale object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning. It is widely used for various models. We are trying to convert the deep PCB Manufacturing defect into COCO Format.

## Dataset Used- 
### Deep PCB
* A dataset contains 1,500 image pairs, each of which consists of a defect-free template image and an aligned tested image with annotations including positions of 6 most common types of PCB defects: open, short, mousebite, spur, pin hole, and spurious copper.
